### Web API to Fetch Emoji Details

The project uses the Emoji API provided by [emojihub.yurace.pro](https://emojihub.yurace.pro/api/all) to fetch emoji details. The API returns response parameters like name, category, group, and HTML code for each emoji.

### Emoji Display and Card Layout

All emojis fetched from the API are displayed on the web page using a card layout. Each card shows the emoji along with its name, category, group, and HTML code.

### Responsive Design

The project's design is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop views. This ensures a consistent user experience across various devices.

### Visually Interactive Design

The design of the web page is visually interactive, making it more engaging for users. Users can see the emoji details displayed in a user-friendly manner.

## Plus Point (Intermediate)

### Filter by Category

In addition to the minimum requirements, this project also includes a feature to filter the displayed emojis by "category." Users can use this filter to view emojis belonging to specific categories.

### Pagination

To improve the user experience, the project implements a pagination feature that lists 10 emojis per page. Users can navigate through different pages to explore more emojis.
